### [TP2 - NURBS, animations and shaders](tp2)
#### Strong Points
 - Our animations are synchronized to produce a bigger animation
 - Creativity at the choice of textures
 - We used creactive freedom to improve the highlight shader so that the texture color still appears.
 - We grouped all primitives that were children of a same component to minimize the number of shader swaps. 

#### Scene Description - Glitched Bakery
  - Overall view of our bakery (now with minecraft textures)![Overall View](tp2/screenshots/scene-overall.png)
  ![Outside NURBS View](tp2/screenshots/improved-shades.png)
  - Out of nowhere an ant was abducted![Animation](tp2/screenshots/abduction.gif)
  - Oh no! There is a barrel ready to explode, maybe the ant abduction was good afterall![Barrel View](tp2/screenshots/nurbs.png)
